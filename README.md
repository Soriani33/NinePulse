# NinePulse
NinePulse is a lightweight web app that creates meaningful three-word Arabic phrases in three rolls, then gives you a bonus discovery link based on the result. It uses seeded randomness from date, time, and location for unique outcomes, works entirely in the browser, and needs no accounts or APIs. Clean UI, fast load, and privacy friendly.
